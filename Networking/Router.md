A router is a [[Network]] device that connects different types of networks and directs data traffic between them. It operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model, where it uses IP addresses to determine the best path for data to reach its destination.

### **Additional Details:**

1. **Functionality:**
    
    - Routers analyze incoming data packets, determine their destination addresses, and forward them to the appropriate network.
    - They enable communication between local networks (LANs) and external networks, such as the internet.
2. **Routing Protocols:**
    
    - Routers use protocols like RIP (Routing Information Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to dynamically determine the best routes for data.
3. **Key Features:**
    
    - **NAT (Network Address Translation):** Allows multiple devices in a private network to share a single public IP address.
    - **Firewall Functions:** Many routers include basic security features to filter and block unwanted traffic.
    - **QoS (Quality of Service):** Manages bandwidth to prioritize certain types of data, such as video streaming or VoIP.
4. **Types of Routers:**
    
    - **Home Routers:** Connect home networks to the internet and typically include [[WI-FI (Wireless Fidelity)]] capabilities.
    - **Enterprise Routers:** Used in businesses to manage large-scale traffic between multiple networks or data centers.
    - **Core Routers:** High-capacity routers used by internet service providers to direct traffic across the backbone of the internet.
5. **Difference from Switches:**
    
    - A [[Switch]] connects devices within the same network (Layer 2), while a router connects different networks and routes traffic based on IP addresses (Layer 3).
